        was <em>The Message<\/em> written? The best answer to that question comes
        from Eugene Peterson himself: \"While I was teaching a class on Galatians,
        I began to realize that the adults in my class weren''t feeling the vitality
        and directness that I sensed as I read and studied the New Testament in its
        original Greek. Writing straight from the original text, I began to attempt
        to bring into English the rhythms and idioms of the original language. I knew
        that the early readers of the New Testament were captured and engaged by these
        writings and I wanted my congregation to be impacted in the same way. I hoped
        to bring the New Testament to life for two different types of people: those
        who hadn''t read the Bible because it seemed too distant and irrelevant and
        those who had read the Bible so much that it had become ''old hat.''\" <\/p>\n\n      <p>Peterson''s
        parishioners simply weren''t connecting with the real meaning of the words
        and the relevance of the New Testament for their own lives. So he began to
        bring into English the rhythms and idioms of the original ancient Greek&#151;writing
        straight out of the Greek text without looking at other English translations.
        As he shared his version of Galatians with them, they quit stirring their
        coffee and started catching Paul''s passion and excitement as he wrote to
        a group of Christians whom he was guiding in the ways of Jesus Christ. For
        more than two years, Peterson devoted all his efforts to <em>The Message New
        Testament<\/em>. His primary goal was to capture the tone of the text and
        the original conversational feel of the Greek, in contemporary English.<\/p>\n\n      <p>Language
        changes. New words are formed. Old words take on new meaning. There is a need
        in every generation to keep the language of the gospel message current, fresh,
        and understandable&#151;the way it was for its very first readers. That is
        what <em>The Message<\/em> seeks to accomplish for contemporary readers. It
        is a version for our time&#151;designed to be read by contemporary people
        in the same way as the original <em> koine<\/em> Greek and Hebrew manuscripts
        were savored by people thousands of years ago. <\/p>\n\n      <p>That''s why
        NavPress felt the time was right for a new version. When we hear something
        over and over again in the same way, we can become so familiar with it that
        the text loses its impact. The Message strives to help readers hear the living
        Word of God&#151;the Bible&#151;in a way that engages and intrigues us right
        where we are. <br><br>\n\n      <p>Some people like to read the Bible in Elizabethan
        English. Others want to read a version that gives a close word-for-word correspondence
        between the original languages and English. Eugene Peterson recognized that
        the original sentence structure is very different from that of contemporary
        English. He decided to strive for the spirit of the original manuscripts&#151;to
        express the rhythm of the voices, the flavor of the idiomatic expressions,
        the subtle connotations of meaning that are often lost in English translations.<\/p>\n\n      <p>The
        goal of <em>The Message<\/em> is to engage people in the reading process and
        help them understand what they read. This is not a study Bible, but rather
        \"a reading Bible.\" The verse numbers, which are not in the original documents,
        have been left out of the print version to facilitate easy and enjoyable reading.
        The original books of the Bible were not written in formal language. <em>The
        Message<\/em> tries to recapture the Word in the words we use today. <\/p>\n    ","lang_name":"English
