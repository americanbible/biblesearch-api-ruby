        give thanks to God, whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors
        did. I thank him as I remember you always in my prayers night and day. <\/span><span
        class=\"v55_1_4\"><sup id=\"2Tim.1.4\" class=\"v55_1_4\">4<\/sup>I remember

        I remember the sincere faith you have, the kind of faith that your grandmother

        reason I remind you to keep alive the gift that God gave you when I laid my
        hands on you. <\/span><span class=\"v55_1_7\"><sup id=\"2Tim.1.7\" class=\"v55_1_7\">7<\/sup>For
        the Spirit that God has given us does not make us timid; instead, his Spirit
        fills us with power, love, and self-control.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span

        ashamed, then, of witnessing for our Lord; neither be ashamed of me, a prisoner
        for Christ''s sake. Instead, take your part in suffering for the Good News,
        as God gives you the strength for it. <\/span><span class=\"v55_1_9\"><sup

        his own people, not because of what we have done, but because of his own purpose
        and grace. He gave us this grace by means of Christ Jesus before the beginning
        of time, <\/span><span class=\"v55_1_10\"><sup id=\"2Tim.1.10\" class=\"v55_1_10\">10<\/sup>but
        now it has been revealed to us through the coming of our Savior, Christ Jesus.
        He has ended the power of death and through the gospel has revealed immortal
        life.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span class=\"v55_1_11\"><sup id=\"2Tim.1.11\"

        class=\"v55_1_12\">12<\/sup>and it is for this reason that I suffer these
        things. But I am still full of confidence, because I know whom I have trusted,
        and I am sure that he is able to keep safe until that Day what he has entrusted
        to me.  <\/span><span class=\"v55_1_13\"><sup id=\"2Tim.1.13\" class=\"v55_1_13\">13<\/sup>Hold
        firmly to the true words that I taught you, as the example for you to follow,
        and remain in the faith and love that are ours in union with Christ Jesus.

        Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he cheered me up many
        times. He was not ashamed that I am in prison, <\/span><span class=\"v55_1_17\"><sup
        id=\"2Tim.1.17\" class=\"v55_1_17\">17<\/sup>but as soon as he arrived in
